This is the first SPA (Single Page Application) that I developed using Vue as Javascript framework, its main functionality is to offer an answer to a question that the user can enter through a form field, it returns as an answer YES, NO or MAYBE, the answer is brought from a third party API (https://yesno.wtf/).
</p>
    <p>
Thanks to this I was able to understand and put into practice fundamental concepts of Vue such as declarative rendering, directives, events, event handling, Single File Components, conditional rendering, among others.
</p>
      <p>
In addition to this, I implemented a series of unit tests to the application using Jest, I had not had much contact with testing in the applications I had developed up to this point but certainly applying unit tests to this small app I could learn in an introductory way how to perform unit tests on the components of an application and thus lay the foundation for further learning more about testing.

## Tech Stack
 
- SASS
- Vue.JS
- Jest (unit testing)
